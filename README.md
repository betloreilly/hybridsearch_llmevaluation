Emily's CV indicates that she is a strong candidate for the Product Manager role. Her experience in SaaS product development is particularly relevant, as this is a key aspect of the role. Her understanding of user-centered design principles also aligns well with the requirements of the position. Emily's passion for delivering products that solve real-world problems suggests that she is motivated and driven, which are important qualities for a Product Manager. 

However, without more specific details about her previous roles, achievements, and the scale of the projects she has managed, it's difficult to fully assess her suitability. For example, information about her experience in leading teams, her ability to work with cross-functional teams, her strategic thinking skills, and her knowledge of the specific industry would be useful. 

Based on the information provided, I would give Emily a score of 7 out of 10 for the Product Manager role. This score could potentially be higher if more detailed information about her experience and skills was provided.
