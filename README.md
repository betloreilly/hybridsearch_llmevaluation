## Astra DB's Hybrid Search and LLM Evalualiton
The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to build a system that can efficiently identify and evaluate the top job opportunities for candidates.

We will build together a sample end-to-end use case that will be able to find and evaluate the best job opportunities for candidates by using the power of LLM and Astra Hybrid Search capabilities.
